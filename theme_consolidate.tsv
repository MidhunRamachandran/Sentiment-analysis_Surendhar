I've not used any metal spoons /abrasive to wash it. I was trying to give maximum care yet the coating has started to peel off. Gotta throw it now. Better buy something else Maybe stainless steel would be better! Update : I contacted the Kaviraj company and they replaced with a new Kadhai. And this kadhai has 1 year warranty.
