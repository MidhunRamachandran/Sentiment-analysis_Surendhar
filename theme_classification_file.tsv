134	40113971	91	Coating peeling off after 5 months. But Replaced. It was all good for 5 months. At the end of 5 months the non stick coating started to peel off. I've not used any metal spoons /abrasive to wash it. I was trying to give maximum care yet the coating has started to peel off. Gotta throw it now. Better buy something else Maybe stainless steel would be better! Update : I contacted the Kaviraj company and they replaced with a new Kadhai. And this kadhai has 1 year warranty. And replacement was pretty easy.	coat peel months but replace good months end months non stick coat start peel I have not use metal spoon abrasive wash try give maximum care yet coat have start peel get throw now better buy something else maybe stainless steel would better update contact kaviraj company replace new kadhai kadhai have year warranty replacement pretty easy	3	POSITIVE	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE	replace	quality
